              <h2>Matthew Walton intro bio</h2>

              <p class="bio-content">
                I'm Matthew Walton, a FullStack Developer from Missouri. I grew
                up in Mount Vernon, Washington, during the 80s and 90s.
                My grandpa was a computer enthusiast who inspired me to explore
                the world of computers. He would always encourage me to spend as
                much time as possible on the computer. He even told me that I
                needed to learn as many computer skills as possible, because one
                day when I became older, everyone would be walking around with
                computers in their hands.I thought my grandpa was crazy at the
                time. I didn't believe him until around 2006 or 2007, six or
                seven years after his death, when I saw the first iPhone
                commercial. That's when I started to believe him. I've mainly
                worked with Windows computers because they're convenient and
                widely available. However, I've never been a fan of Windows; the
                reason is simple. Windows, or Microsoft in general, makes
                everything more difficult, and they seem to presure you into their
                products. I don't like Apple products either. I
                can't stand Apple products. My reasons for not liking Apple are
                that in the early 2000s, Apple tried to say that the Apple Mac
                wasn't a PC, it was a Mac. Yet Steve Jobs called Apple computers
                in the '70s and '80s a PC, a personal computer. He coined the
                buzzword "PC," and then later on in the early 2000s went back
                and said, "Oh, it's not a PC, it's a Mac," as if a Mac were
                fundamentally different from a PC.</p><p class="bio-content">I like Linux, but I've used
                Windows most of my life. So I used Windows with WSL and Linux
                Ubuntu in my terminal. I don't like gaming with my computers
                either. I would rather have a dedicated machine for that, like a PS4 or PS5. I also
                avoid anti-virus software on my computers. I find it slows them
                down, it's often unhelpful, and it's usually not lightweight, Beside's windows has
                build-in security and same with google chrome. I lived through a lot of computer
                history, and it has envolution along side of me growing up. I
                remember the days before the internet and the excitement when
                residential internet arrived, making it accessible to everyone.
                I remember the AOL days, dial-up connections, and Netscape, my
                first browser, as well as the advent of email. When our teacher
                took us to the computer lab to learn about email, I told her I
                wasn't interested. I didn't see the need for it.She said,
                "Well, you might need to send an email someday." I replied,
                "Most people I know don't even know what the internet is, let
                alone email!" Little did she know, I already knew how to send
                emails. I was an avid Napster user, sharing massive music files.
                It was a revolutionary concept at the time. Even Spotify can't
                compare to the old music-sharing system. Spotify emerged as a
                response to music piracy, which didn't disappear with Napster.
                I'm proud to say that I've been a FullStack Developer for over
                3 years now. I've worked on a variety of projects. I'm passionate about
                helping others learn about technology and coding. I'm also a big
                fan of open-source software. I'm excited to see what the future
                holds for me as a developer. I'm always learning new things and
                I'm excited to continue to grow in my career. I just need a job that can 
              give me my indepence to continue, I still do it anyways everyday after work.</p>
